  <h3>Educational jargon used on this page:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Learning_Objectives'>Student Learning Objective (SLO)</a></strong>: a described item that a student should learn or be able to do at the end of a lesson</li>
    <li><strong><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum'>Curriculum</a></strong>: a set of SLOs that collectively represent a body of knowledge and the roadmap to its development for a student (commonly used by teachers to plan and interconnect lessons)</li>    
  </ul>
  <h2>Goal 1: Build a Fab Academy style curriculum for younger learners that is free and open for all to use</h2>
  <!--
  <p>
    One of the most important pieces to maintain a free and growing society is that there are people who are enabled to 
    build, design and rethink their environments. This requires that people are able to not only understand the things they 
    interact with, but are skilled anough to manipulate them to meet their needs. In the past, humans learned to do this with a limited
    set of raw materials. In the modern world, there is an entire supply chain that exists and offers an industrious person the ability
    to build things that were impossible a generation ago. By being able to build your own world, people will be able to crowd source 
    the development of their future, in same way that we have for the entire past of our species. If the ability to develop new applications, devices, 
    and technologies is restricted to only a few highly skilled people, we risk our society entering a new era of future development guided 
    by a small pool with great responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Students and society stand to gain a great deal if the youth of the world are enabled to build and design with modern technology. Fab Academy 
    has done a great job for many years of supporting the expansion of the open Fab Lab network. For more than 10 years, Fab Academy students 
    of all backgrounds have quickly learned these skills, based on the foundation of their previous knowledge and abilities. Younger students enabled 
    with the same skills will pose even more opportunity for the future of our society, because of their relevant developmental position in 
    space and time. Youth drive the world forward with their fresh perspecive and unfettered questioning of institutions from the past. 
    Enabling today's youth to be relevant content creators in the world is necessary to continue the human 
    tradition of crowd sourcing our own future from the production techniques available in the era.

  <h2>Goal 2: Build a system to make curriculum a positive motivator</h2>
  <p>
    The intent with this project is to make SLOs, and broader curricula, easy to see and understand. This will hopefully 
    cause SLOs to be more extrinsic and observable by both student and teacher. In my own experience, 
    '<a href='https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c1df/e1970305f257b08a9f2b9844b346452eb869.pdf'>gamification</a>' 
    and other non-traditional motivators seem highly effective to guide students through a curriculum and learning activities. 
    There is no shortange of curriculum (at least in the United States) that students can work towards. Breaking down curriculum 
    into small, approachable bits seems critical for moving individual students forward. 
  </p>
  <h2>Why are there two goals?</h2>
  <p>
    I imagine that, in many cases around the world, a Fab Academy style curriculum for younger students will meet a pre-existing curriculum 
    that is intended to ensure that students learn everything they need to function in the society of their teachers. As well intended as 
    intitutionalized academic curriculum may be, these systems often pose the risk of inadvertently neglecting very recent changes in society 
    and/or the personal skills that support the development of their own academic SLOs. Regardless of this, teachers and schools 
    are frequently measured against the locally insituted curriculum as a benchmark for their effectiveness. There is only so much time in 
    a school day and many forces (such as teacher and student performance evaluations) that any good teacher needs to take into 
    account when planning learning for their students. Therefore, teachers and schools may be hesitant to spend time working on Fab Academy 
    style SLOs unless they can clearly see how it supports the curriculum which they will be evaluated against. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Developing the two above goals simultaneously will hopefully allow a useful Fab Academy style K-12 curriculum to be built and implimented. The use of this sytem 
    for measuring progress against SLOs could be used by individuals and within institutions, while maintaining the ability to adapt 
    as a living set of SLOs that is user-friendly and collaborative. Ideally, students should be able to track their personal progress 
    against a flowchart of SLOs that will guide the growth of their skills over time as any curriculum does. However, by being an approachable 
    tool this curriculum could be understood by the students themselves. [Traditional curricula are not intended for student use.] Teachers 
    or parents could then track students' progress though the curriculum flowchart and help them reach their individual goals. Perhaps teachers 
    could even share effective ways to teach and learn specific SLOs or recommend changes to the system. Furthermore, it may be possible to have 
    institutions support the teachers and students by connecting them with other teams working on similar goals or adapting the flowchart
    to better align with locally instituted needs, curriculum and SLOs. There are many possible positive outcomes of co-developing a Fab Academy 
    style curriculum for younger learners with an approachable way to communicate these goals and their benefits to students, teachers,
    and their institutions.
