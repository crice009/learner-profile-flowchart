# Learner Profile Flowchart
As individual students grow and learn, their knowledge base grows and develops. Students organically and individually link ideas in their understanding of the world. Educators do well to tap into that developing konwledge base and move it forward. However, it can be difficult to assess a student's understanding to best help them grow since their understanding framework is entirely hidden within their neurons. this system hopes to bring that into full view for the student, the educator, as well as any supporting institutions so that all can work toward bettering the individual learner.

The original idea for this flowchart style comes from Nick DiGiorgio, of Cleveland.


## Progress Updates:
After a long time staying dormant on this project, we've found good collaborators, and the right toolset to move things forward. There is a landing page that will give the basic overview of the versions up to this point, and a history of where it came from. Check back often to see the progress that may happen here.
