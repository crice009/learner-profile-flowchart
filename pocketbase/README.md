# pocketbase

based on version 1.21.6 of pocketbase, available for download [here](https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz), but you shouldn't need it as all the files are un-tar-ed here already in the repo.

All the rest of the 'business logic' is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) as described [here](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/).
